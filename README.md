# PROJECT1
HR Analytics- Predict Employee Attrition


## HR ANALYTICS â€“ PREDICT EMPLOYEE ATTRITION
This project analyzes employee attrition using classification models and explains the driving factors behind resignations using SHAP. It also provides visual insights using Power BI.


## OBJECTIVE
Identify key factors influencing employee resignation. Build machine learning models to predict attrition. Interpret predictions using SHAP. Create interactive dashboards in Power BI. Recommend actionable strategies to prevent future attrition.


## TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES
Python: Pandas, Scikit-learn, SHAP, Seaborn

Power BI: Data visualizations & slicing

SHAP (for model explainability)

Colab: Model development

Excel: Input dataset

GitHub: Version control


## EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Identified key factors affecting attrition
- Analyzed department-wise trends and salary-level impact
- Visualizations done using Seaborn and Power BI


## MODEL BUILDING
- Model Used: Logistic Regression
- Feature engineering: Label encoding for categorical columns
- Train-test split applied


## EVALUATION
- Classification Report: classification_report.csv
- Confusion Matrix: confusion_matrix.png
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score computed


## DATASET
File: hr_analytics_attrition_dataset.xlsx
Contains features like:
Satisfaction Level
Last Evaluation
Number of Projects
Average Monthly Hours
Time Spent at Company
Work Accident
Promotion in Last 5 Years
Department

## HOW TO RUN(LOCALLY) 
Clone the repository
Install dependencies:
pip install pandas seaborn scikit-learn streamlit joblib shap


## INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
 1.Employees with low satisfaction and no promotions in the last 5 years are at higher risk of leaving.

2.Departments with higher workloads should be monitored.

3.Increasing employee engagement and internal mobility may reduce attrition.
